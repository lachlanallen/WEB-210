          <h1>Lachlan Allen</h1>
          <h2>Front-End Development Student</h2>

          <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction at UNC Charlotte in May 2024. Throughout my studies, I achieved a GPA of 3.71, earning a position on the Chancellor's List. My technical skill set includes programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Python, and I am proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and popular front-end frameworks like React.js. I am continuing to develop these skills while I complete a certificate in Front-end Development at Wake Technical Community College.</p>
          <p>I have practical experience in web application development, acquired through various projects undertaken during my time as a student at UNC Charlotte. During these projects, I engaged in the User Experience design process and front-end development, utilizing tools such as Figma, React.js, and Git. Collaborating with fellow students on many of these projects demonstrated my strong communication, coordination, and successful project delivery within specified deadlines.</p>
